This Credit Simulator is an application developed using C Sharp using the Visual Studio IDE. This application is cross platform strictly on Microsoft Windows products. Meaning it can work on any computer, tablet, and smartphone running Windows. 

The point of this application is to give the user a general understanding of where their credit score standing is based on industry standards from FICO. There's an algorithm behind the application that computes the user's credit standing. The algorithm is composed of FICO's 5 credit score factors.
