In all these years I’ve been programming, my focus has always been on object oriented programming. 
Any time I had to fiddle around with HTML, it was only for a short period or it was for a minuscule assignment in the courses I took. Due to the lack of my exposure to HTML and web development, my perception on these areas in programming was that they 
were boring and a waste time. I specifically viewed HTML as a time consuming language because I was not introduced
to any include or pre-made libraries. Explicitly hard coding each Div, list items, images, borders, and classes was not 
appealing for me. Until I was introduced to Ui Frameworks and Semantic UI in my ICS 314 class.

One of the benefits of Semantic UI compared to other UI frameworks is that it allows websites to look more modern. 
Semantic UI also allows for the users to be able to make the necessary edits and adjustments to give websites a different look and feel. If you look at websites created from Bootstrap and other UI frameworks, those websites essentially look like clones. 
That’s not also factoring in that other UI frameworks look outdated. Talking to my peers, some of them say that other UI’s such as
Bootstrap are a lot easier to use and come with better support since they’ve been around longer. 
So maybe within time, Semantic UI can be viewed the same.

Working with UI Frameworks and Semantic UI was a pleasant and smooth experience for me. 
I was amazed at how it’s so easy to integrate into an IDE and combine it with CSS to easily write HTML for websites. 
I also liked how it’s combined to work flawlessly with Javascript. Semantic UI basically has everything you need to create a working  website while cutting half the time it takes to write the code, in half.
Semantic UI brings cohesiveness and a large number of components that are well designed. 
When we worked on the “YourChoice Wod” it was appalling on how easy it is to remake complex looking websites simply by using Semantic UI. All in all, my experience with Semantic UI and UI Frameworks was a positive one and I'm happy to continue use them.
