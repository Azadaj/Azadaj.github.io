The introduction to the Meteor API was an enjoyable yet burdensome experience for me. To precisely illustrate how complex it was in getting accustomed to Meteor, we took about two weeks in class to learn Meteor, yet fellow classmates and I are still running into issues here and there. However, as trivial as it has been, the benefits of Meteor are immense and the well worth the time spent.

Meteor works like a platform that accepts numerous frameworks. It modifies NodeJS so that it becomes your personal server, and at the same time it also works within your browser. It has everything you need to build and run mobile and web applications. All the commands are executed through a terminal (which makes for a cool-old-school coding approach).Creating an application in Meteor is as simple as writing “meteor create appname”. You then go into your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to access and fiddle with your application.

What I liked the most about Meteor is that once you are finished installing and setting up everything it becomes so easy to use. Occasionally you run into some compatibility issues and some negligible problems here and there, but they are nothing that a simple Google search cannot solve. On the startup of Meteor, Meteor constantly runs checks for the latest updates and patches needed. It’s also very user friendly in the sense that it gives you tips and warnings about the state of your application. 

The framework we used in conjunction with Meteor is called Blaze. Programming using Blaze is super easy and works with IntelliJ IDEA seamlessly. IntelliJ IDEA is always constantly refreshing and sending the latest updates of your application to Meteor. You pretty much only need modest Javascript and NodeJS knowledge to make a working application. The only headaches you will probably run into are those darned imports. Meteor is like a tree. You have to have to everything wired up properly from top to bottom or else all your hard worked code may never display and you might pull all your hair out trying to figure out what went wrong. This happened to me so many times I’m surprised I did not get a self-inflicted stroke. That being said, I recommend any programmer interested in making complex web/mobile applications to get familiar with Meteor. Nothing beats the amount of resources it offers you along with its ease of use (after you properly set everything up).
